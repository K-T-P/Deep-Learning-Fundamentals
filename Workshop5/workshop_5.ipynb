    "I can not draw the figure for weights,biases and all the other things that are very essential to have a deep understanding of RNN so Please check out [this insightful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E65LDnM2cA&list=PL1F3ABbhcqa3BBWo170U4Ev2wfsF7FN8l) on RNN by Andrew NG and a very [intutive video by MIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEnXr6v2ifU&t=1398s) before you start.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<font color='teal'>RNN helps wherever we need context from the previous input such as:**</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Language to Language Translation (Many to Many Articture: Many inputs Many Outputs)\n",
    "2. Sentimeny Analysis (Many to One Articture: Many inputs One Output)\n",
    "3. Music, Story Generation (One to Many Articture: One input Many Outputs)\n",
    "\n",
    "**<font color='red'>We're talking about the `Many to Many Architecture Below`</font>**\n",
    "\n",
    "RNN are specialised version of Neural Networks which deals with the time aspect as well. For instance, given a sentence like `Because Eminem is the only Rapper to win an Oscar, best selling rapper of all time, most top Billboards and has got 15 Grammy award wins so it makes him the ____` can have a complex structure because filling the right word as `GOD/GOAT/Best` is linked to the first word itself and has a relation with the entire sequence of the words. Simple Dense networds can not address the problem so to get the results in the sentence, we have to get the relation from the past where the output is based on  `only,rapper,win,Oscar,most,selling,all,time,most,top,billboards,15,Grammy`. So in order to teach the model, RNN are used where an output is based only not only on the inputs but the previous outputs too.\n",
    "\n",
    "RNN have <font color='green'>**BPTT**: **Back Propagation Through Time**</font> which is a specialised version of Back Propagation Algorithm to train RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, BPTT works by unrolling all input timesteps. Each timestep has one input timestep, one copy of the network, and one output. Errors are then calculated and accumulated for each timestep. The network is rolled back up and the weights are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradients will have to be called for the past cells too so if layers are in thousands so BPTT can be computationally expensive as the number of timesteps increases and it also leads to Vanishing gradients (no change in Gradients) or exploding (gradients changing too fast).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working and feeding data into RNN for NLP?\n",
    "Unlike the data that we feed in simple DNN, we feed the data at time intervals. Let us see by an example.\n",
    "Suppose we have the Sentence `Eminem is the GOAT` and the vector representation of it suppose `[1,2,3,4]` and we want to train a super slow but intelligent model model of just 1 cell or layer in RNN `(t-1 only)`. So insted of feeding the whole instance at 12:00 PM, it'll feed starting hidden state as `h_start` (which is generally random or 0) and `1`  which is notation for  `Eminem` at 12:00 PM and generate an output say `99` and a hidden state `h0` at 12:01. At 12:02, We'll feed the model with past state `h0` and the current input `2` to get a result `42` and a modified hidden state from `h0 -> h1` at 12:03 and it goes on until the end of the vector. By the time our model finish training, it would have produced a vector of results and a final state `h_end`(which is of no use now except we are using Encoder-Decoder) which interprets to  `He is indeed GOD. Period`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<font color='red'>NOTE: RNN uses SAME function (mostly`tanh`) as activation function and SAME weight matrix `W` to calculate the variables at EACH TIME STEP. Depending on the requirements, there can be multiple Weight Matrices for example one weight matrix  (`Wh`) that gets multiplied by the previous hidden state (`h_old`), another one as (`Wx`) that gets multiplied by input (`x_in`).`h_now = tanh(Wh*h_old + Wx*x_in)`. To calculate the current output as (`y_now`), we use another weight matrix (`Wy`)  so that `y_now = softmax(Wy * h_now)`</font>**\n",
    "\n",
    "**<font color='teal'>Note: Hidden State is not a scaler but has dimension `d`.Hidden state represent how many different features you want to remember for either short term or long term (in LSTM's context). Hidden States tend to do something like this:</font>**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remember the context\n",
    "2. Remeber the Grammar\n",
    "3. Preserve the style words have been used\n",
    "4. etc... etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "**<font color='maroon'>Data should be of same length for all of the Training instances for most of the basic Deep Learning models (except sequence-to-seqence, attention etc)**</font>. You can not pass in Vectors of different length to the model such as `Eminem is the best rapper` and `Eminem is the best rapper born EOD`. You need to either truncate the second one or to pad the first one. People mostly use the padding where the sentence with the maximum length is considered as base and a unique vector is appended to the each sentence in the end to mae the vectors of same size. By doing that, our second sentence will become `Eminem is the best rapper -PAD- PAD-` and it'll become `[1,2,3,4,777,777]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There might be times when your model will encounter some words that it is unaware of. For example we have the sentence `But Kanye has more Grammys. Now What?`. Our model will literally throw an error like `Kanye?? WHO???? I don't know that name. Never Heard of this word`. So to overcome the problem, another unidentified token is attached as -UN- to make the sentence as `But -UN- has more Grammys` and the result for that would be `For Producing Music mostly not Rapping, got it?`."

So like this, we have 3 features in our hand for 2 different attributes. What if I ask that what is difference between a `plastic bag` and `6ix9ine`??? You have no idea what that can be. You can't tell that both tend to have `garbage mostly`  until yov've seen the workings of both. This is exactly what we call `Embeddings` or `Latent Features`. Our Model can generate `K` new features from the existing `N` features in the data so that the model can learn from the hidden features insted of those original features. So if we train on the `lyrics of 6ix9ne`, `essays about garbage`, `Eminem biography` etc etc, it'll tend to put the first 2 in the category of `trash` and the last one as `legend` even if the computer has no knowledge about what just happed. I Guess my model is more intelligent and has better music taste than many people out there ;)\n",

    "# Bidirectional RNN/ LSTM\n",
    "These are specialised version of RNN which not only look at the past but the future too. Means instead of looking at 1 word at time, they look at two words but in opposite direction. Don't worry, let us try to see with an example. Suppose we have sentence `Shady Records not shady plans`. In the birdirectional structure, we'll ave 2 `pipelines` (RNN Cells) working in different direction. First will be like a simple RNN reading words `H0` + `Shady` -> `H1` -> `H1`+ Records -> `H2` and so on .... In the same time, there will be another RNN cells working backwards in the same way.. They'll be Doing `H_0` + `plans` -> `H_1` -> `H_1` + `shady` -> `H_2` and so on..... So in this way, the first output at time step `T0` will be a combination of both **First Hidden State from One Pipeline + Last Hidden State from Second Line**. And for the Last Time stem `Tn`, it'll be **Last Hidden State of one Pipeline + First Hidden State of Second Pipeline**. In this way, it'll calculate First to last and last to first states simultaneously. So the two hidden states will updted by not just past but Future too.\n",

    "# Embeddings\n",
    "## Text as Numbers\n",
    "Before we start on Embeddings let us talk about how you can represent text? Text is, youn know \"text\" and machines only know numbers so in order to tell the machine about the text, we use different approaches most widely as `Boolean Matrix or One Hot Encoding`, `Frquency Based or TfIdf` and `Sementic Based or Embeddings`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example in the sentence `Messi, Eminem and Lebron, they all have achieved greatness to a certain level that it seems like nobody in the near future is going to be even closeer to the half way mark.`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are few choices and the simplese being is giving each unique word a number and getting a vector of length  equal to the total number of words in the sentence. So let us suppose Messi becomes 1, Eminem becomes 2 and so on to represent all the sentences. But the problem with this method is that the model will think Eminem `2` has more influence than Messi `1` in the sentence but in fact there is no ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color='teal'>Boolean Vectors:</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can have a work around it. We can take every word in all the sentences and and make a vector of length equal to all the number of all the unique words in all the sentences and replace. For example in the 3 sentences, `My name is Marshall`, `Shady is my alter ego`,` Eminem is my stage name`, We'll have 9 unique words ans every sentence will be represented by a vector of length 9 where every word will be represented by a 1 if present at a certain location. For example if `name` is represented by the 2nd index, then in the **First** and **Third** sentence, the second index will be a 1 instead of zero where in the **Second** sentence, it'll be a zero because in First and thrird, `name` is present and is defined by the index position 2. This is all cool until it's not. There are lots of problems with the scenario. For example, if a sentence comes, `Hi!!`, then it'll be adding one more dto the length of vector and even though it's length is just one, it'll be represented by a vector of length 10 where 9 of the indices are filled by 0. Another problem is that when a sentence like `Shady is not shady by heart` comes, even though the word `shady` has come twice, it'll be a single 1 at the inde defined so model will have no way of knowing whether the word came 1 or 1000 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color='teal'>Frequency Based:</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can modify the above problem by giving the position a number equal to the frequeny of word  ( how many times the word has repeated in the sentence) so at a defined index of `Shady`, it'll be a 2. Now let us think about pronouns, articles and connectors. They repeat a lot and lot (a,an,the,at,from,on ...bla bla bla..) So if a frequency is given, again it'll make the model think that `at` is more **TfIdf: Tern Frequency Inverse Term Frequency**. What it does is that it gives the words more weightage which appear more in a document. For example in an article Title about `Eminem is the Greatest: Why?` there will be lots of times when `Eminem` and `greatest` will be there that can easily define the Title of the Article but lots of time there will be `a,an,the,at` will bethere in article too which can hamper. So `TfIdf` surely gives more weightage to the words repeated in lines but it'll penalize the words which comes too often in the whole article which will surely be the non essential words like `a,an,the` etc. This methos eeems perfect but  what about when we want to find the relation of `Eminem` to the `Greatest`?? There is no way to find that using any of the above techniques. This is where the Next Part Comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution to all the problems lies in the Embeddings. Word embedding methods learn a real-valued vector representation for a predefined fixed sized vocabulary from a corpus of text. The learning process is either joint with the neural network model on some task, such as document classification, or is an unsupervised process, using document statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confused?? Don't be. Word Embeddings are the Words converted to a Vector of Length  `N` which consists floating values usually in range 0-1. These vectors are not at random but they are there for a reason. If the distance between 2 vectors are small in that embedding means that those two vectors are somehow (and I mean SOMEHOW) related. In this context, we'll say that the disctance of the vector formed by `Moon` will closer to`Earth`  tha `Apple`. Simlarly, the embeddings can JUSt KNOW that Paris, New Delhi and London are related and will have very short distances. These Embeddings represent N dimensional HIDDEN features between words. For Example there are 3 hidden features explored by Embeddings by words as `[Scary`, `Soft` ,`Intelligent]` in the range 0-1. If we have 3 words as ``Cat``,`Gun` and `Human`, then the vector for `Human = [0.3, 0.3, 0.9], Gun = [0.8, 0.1, 0.01], Cat = [0.4, 0.9, 0,4]`. Which means that Human is somewhat scary, somewhat sft but highly intelligent and a cat is scary but super soft. The only thing to note here is that the **Machine Learning Model does not even know what  it has found. To the model, these are some random dimensions and according to these dimensions, these words (one hot encoded vectors) relate.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever I have just described can be seen viually and mathematically by watching [this Andrew NG video](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/nlp-sequence-models/word-representation-6Oq70)\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to?\n",
    "Embeddings are generally generated by using the statistical means on a **HUGE CORPUS OF CLEANED DATA**. There are predefined embeddings such as Google's Word2Vec and Stanford's GloVe but you can use your own Embeddings too by using an `EmbeddingLayer` as the first layer in any Neural Network. The dimension of this layer will be the number of hidden features you want to get and the updated with each epochs will be in a manner to get the context from your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very detailed and intutive explanation about Embeddings and it's types is given in [this post](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-word-embeddings/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using **GLoVE** which is a hybrid approach to mix both the global statistics of matrix factorization techniques like LSA with the local context-based learning in Word2Vec. Rather than using a window to define local context, GloVe constructs an explicit word-context or word co-occurrence matrix using statistics across the whole text corpus. The result is a learning model that may result in generally better word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "GloVe has used  `word-co-occurnce` and `Nearst Neighbour` to get all these embeddings using a Neural Network. It mans that given a word, it tries to find the similar words used in the same **CONTEXT** and given a context, it tries to find words that can be used in the same context. For example let us assume that as `Lionel` and `Messi` are used most of the times together so given `Lionel`, it'll try to predict `Messi` and vice versa (word-Co-occurance). In the same way `Messi` and `Football` are used together in the same context so when you try to look up for similar words as `Messi`, it'll give you `Football` (context).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working of GloVe\n",
    "Working of GloVe is quite interesting. It has learned that `man+feminine` = `woman`  so `king+femenine` = `queen`. In other words, it can find the relation that if you subtract the two vectors and add the third vector, it can find a 4th vector which is related to 3rd vector in the same 2nd is related to 1st. For example if you do, `woman-man+king`, it'll return `queen` as `woman-man` will give you the `femenine` dimension and adding femenine to king will be equal to queen.# Thank You\n",
    "In the next part, We'll be covering Embeddings (such as GloVe, Word2Vec), Sequence-to-Sequence Modelling, Attention Modelling with Google's BERT to perform tasks which are not possible with fixed length inputs and outputs."

    "\n",
    "1. **Library Installation**: First, install the `yfinance` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Download**: Download Bitcoin prices using the `download` function in `yfinance`. Use the USD-BTC symbol and set the data range from `2019-01-01` to `2024-01-01`. Use data up to `2024-01-01` for training and after that date for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Plotting Data**: To verify the above steps, plot this data over time, assigning different colors to training and testing data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Normalization**: For better model training, normalize the values on the y-axis. Use the `MinMaxScaler` function from the `scikit-learn` library, with only the training data as the basis for scaling both the training and testing datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Preparation**: Prepare the data required for model training and testing. Define a variable representing the number of previous data points to use for predictions (e.g., if set to 60, each prediction considers the past 60 data points). Based on this example, the dataset dimensions would be:\n",

    "6. **Model Creation**: Construct a pytorch model similar to the one shown in the provided example.\n",

    "   - **Epochs**: 100\n",
    "   - **Batch Size**: 32\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Prediction and Plotting**: After training, make predictions on the test data and plot the predictions alongside the actual values. The plot should have time on the x-axis, and different colors for actual and predicted values.\n",
